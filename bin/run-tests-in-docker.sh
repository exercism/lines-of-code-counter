# Synopsis:
# Test the lines of code counter Docker image by running it against a predefined set of 
# submissions with an expected output.
# The Docker image is built automatically.

# Arguments:
# $1: track slug (optional)
# $2: submission slug (optional)

# Output:
# Outputs the diff of the expected counts against the actual counts
# generated by the lines of code counter Docker image.

# Example:
# ./bin/run-tests-in-docker.sh

# Example running tests of a single track:
# ./bin/run-tests-in-docker.sh csharp

# Example running tests of a single track and a single submission slug:
# ./bin/run-tests-in-docker.sh csharp single-file
