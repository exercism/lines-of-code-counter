#! /bin/bash

# Synopsis:
# Test the lines of code counter by running it against a predefined set of solutions 
# with an expected output.

# Arguments:
# $1: track slug (optional)
# $2: submission slug (optional)

# Output:
# Outputs the diff of the expected counts against the actual counts
# generated by the lines of code counter.

# Example:
# ./bin/run-tests.sh

# Example running tests of a single track:
# ./bin/run-tests.sh csharp

# Example running tests of a single track and a single submission:
# ./bin/run-tests.sh csharp single-solution-file
